The Odin Project (TOP)'s Foundations Flexbox course: [Landing Page Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

This project tested my fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. The webpage has not been optimized for mobile devices at this time, however once Responsive Design has been learned and understood, I may return to this project. I opted to replicate the provided TOP design almost 1-to-1 for the purpose of time efficiency. Prioritizing testing my knowledge and understand, first and foremost.
